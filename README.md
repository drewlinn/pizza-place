Object Oriented JavaScript Independent Project

This webpage is my Independent Project for Epicodus evening Intro to Programming course. (3/29/2017)

By Andrew Dalton, Epicodus, Bootstrap, JQuery-3.2.0

Description

This webpage allows the user to customize and order a pizza.

Specifications

Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

If you finish meeting the objectives for this project, consider adding additional features, such as:

Style your site with CSS and images.
Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings.
Display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details.
Offer a delivery option that then requires address information.
